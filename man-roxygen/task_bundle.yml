ids:
  short: >-
    Return the vector of ids for the bundle (will return
    \code{character(0)} if the bundle is empty).

status:
  short: >-
    Fetch the current task status (see \code{\link{task}}).

  params:
    follow_redirect: &follow_redirect >-
      should we follow redirects to get the status of any requeued task?

results:
  short: >-
    Fetch results for all tasks, immediately (unlike \code{wait}).
  params:
    follow_redirect: *follow_redirect

  value: >-

    Always returns a list, regardless of how many tasks are in the
    bundle \code{list()} for zero tasks, \code{list(x1)} for one task,
    \code{list(x1, x2)} for two, etc).  This list will be named with
    the ids (see \code{ids()}) unless the bundles has a \code{names}
    attribute that has not been invalidated by using
    \code{update_groups()} (this interface may change).

wait:
  short: >-
    Like \code{results}, but block until results are returned.

  params:
    timeout: >-

      Total time to wait, in seconds.  If the tasks have not returned
      by this point an error willl be thrown.

    time_poll: >-

      Interval, in seconds, to poll for new results.  Increasing this
      time will reduce the number of Redis roundtrips but decrease the
      responsiveness to an interrupt.

    progress_bar: >-

      Display a progress bar while waiting?  Includes a spinner for
      reassurance that the process has not died.

    follow_redirect: *follow_redirect

times:
  short: >-
    Like times in \code{\link{observer}}, but limited to the ids in the bundle.

  params:
    unit_elapsed: >-
      Unit to use in computing elapsed times.  The default is to use
      "secs".  This is passed through to \code{\link{difftime}} so the
      units there are available and are "auto", "secs", "mins",
      "hours", "days", "weeks".

update_groups:
  short: >-

    Check for new tasks that have been added to the groups included in
    this bunddle and add these tasks to the bundle.

  value: >-

    Invisibly, the ids of tasks that have been added to the bundle.
